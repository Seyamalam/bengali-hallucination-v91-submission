## Frozen configuration

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Kaggle notebook | [`seyamalam/bengali-hallucination-v91-compliance-inference`, version 3](https://www.kaggle.com/code/seyamalam/bengali-hallucination-v91-compliance-inference/versions/3) |
| Hardware | **Tesla T4 ×2** |
| Runtime reported in organizer form | **0.17 hours = 10 minutes 12 seconds = 612 seconds** |
| Slowest measured full run | **9 minutes 53.43 seconds = 593.43 seconds for all 2,516 rows** |
| Internet | Disabled |
| Model | [`Qwen3.6-27B-Q4_K_P`, version 1](https://www.kaggle.com/models/snowrab/qwen3-6-27b-q4-k-p/pyTorch/default/1) |
| Public knowledge/runtime dataset | [`bengali-hallucination-phase2-runtime-v91`, version 4](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seyamalam/bengali-hallucination-phase2-runtime-v91/versions/4) |
| Public CUDA runtime | [`llama.cpp CUDA b9637`, version 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/seyamalam/bengali-hallucination-llama-cpp-cuda-b9637-public/versions/2) |
| Competition input | `/kaggle/input/competitions/bengali-hallucination/test set.csv` |

The notebook is offline and produces `submission.csv` directly from the raw
competition input. It never loads a saved Phase 1 prediction vector and does
not depend on the Phase 1 row count.

Version 3 completed in `440.8734s` on T4×2 and produced a CSV byte-identical
to the scored v91 submission.

## Measured Phase 2 execution

The organizer-executed notebook completed the 5,000-row held-out input on
Tesla T4 x2 in `13,921.9134s`, or **3 hours 52 minutes 1.91 seconds**. The
router resolved 207 rows (4.14%) and sent 4,793 rows (95.86%) to Qwen. Output
validation completed successfully. This is runtime evidence only; no Phase 2
accuracy result is claimed without the organizer's score. See
`PHASE2_RUNTIME_EVIDENCE.md` for the complete measured breakdown.

The scored router includes short, citation-backed factual answer records
researched from public sources. We disclosed the construction to the
organizers. They replied that a solution without manually labeled rows, API
calls, or other rulebook violations would not be disqualified. No hidden label
was available or used, and the notebook computes every output from raw rows and
pinned evidence.

## Phase 2 replacement

The organizers replace only the file mounted at:

```python
TEST_PATH = Path(
    "/kaggle/input/competitions/bengali-hallucination/test set.csv"
)
```

No notebook variable needs to be edited for the held-out set. The notebook
infers `N` from that file, preserves its IDs in order, and writes exactly
`id,label`.
