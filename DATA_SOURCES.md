# External data and evidence sources

Only `dataset samples.json`, `test set.csv`, and `sample submission.csv` were supplied by the competition. Everything below was external and used for lineage auditing, retrieval, controlled-pair generation, validation, or deterministic evidence. “Used” does not mean that every record was treated as ground truth.

Several public Bengali antonym sites and Bengali Wiktionary were also used for multi-source lexical corroboration. Their exact URLs and source relations are recorded in the evidence artifacts and historical README. The scanned *বিপরীতার্থক শব্দের অভিধান* was acquired but not counted as parsed decision evidence because its scan lacked a usable Bengali text layer.

The disabled `shayekh/bengali-exams-public` and `shayekh/bengali-exams` acquisition candidates were not included in the reported corpus and are not counted above.
